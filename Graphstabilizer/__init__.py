"""
A package for graph states. There is barely any documentation, provided completely as-is, and conatins (probably) a lot of bugs.
Use at your own risk.

The main Graphstate class can be imported from Graphstabilizer.states.

The Adjacencymatrix class can be imported from Graphstabilizer.graphs.elementary

Graphstabilizer.graphs contains a lot of useful modules, with functions to calculate permutations, orbits, marginal ranks, create drawings etc.
